# FlatByTheCemetery
<em>Author: David O'Gara</em>

The Flat by the Cemetery is a full-stack portfolio app that showcases the art/illustrion work of David O'Gara. 

## Goal

Although not an artist by profession the idea serves as a useful addition to my web development portfolio and this full-stack version provides a progression marker from my first project of the same name within the Code Institiute Full Stack Developer course.

## About the title and colour scheme

The title for the site, 'Flat by the Cemetery' was chosen simply due to the fact the the sites author has lived for some years in an apartment building across from an old cemetery and had been using it already as an Instagram handle where much the artwork is already shared.

The colour scheme follows on from this theme in direct homage to a poster of the Luci Fulci film 'House by the Cemetery' that was displayed in the apartment after moving in. This color scheme is black for the background, white for the text and red for highlights such as headings and active links.

## About the font choice

The font choice for the site is the serif font Palatino as this resembles the text of a paperback novel and fits within the sites themes of horror-fiction.
